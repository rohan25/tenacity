0.3.3-SNAPSHOT
--------------
* Dropwizard 0.7.1
* Force hystrix-codahale to depend on metrics 3.0.2, until [pull request 279](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/pull/279) is merged
* Upgrade to findbugs 2.5.4

0.3.2
-----
* Under high contention it's possible for HystrixThreadPoolMetrics to be associated with an incorrect TheadPoolExecutor.
This manifests itself as showing the incorrect metrics because the executor being used by Hystrix is different from the one
being used to supply metrics. As a temporary fix we now ensure that for any given ThreadPoolKey we only ever construct one pool.
This will be removed once it's fixed in upstream Hystrix. [pull request 270](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/pull/270)
